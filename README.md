# Form-Filling-bot

Currently using edge browser because latest chrome version didnt provide required drivers.

I have put my drivers in a a folder and added path to environment variable.

while using drivers use  " Service  " you can find how to use it in the code 

**unable to fill wpforms can access them through ID but not css selectors**
